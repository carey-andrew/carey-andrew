### Hi there 👋
🔭 I’ve recently completed the School of code bootcamp, presenting our final project on Jan 10th.
On Github you can find the project that we built in 4 weeks - Bubble, as well as other apps that I have made as part of my learning.

🌱 I’m currently working on a portfolio website, applying for my first role and creating a roadmap to develop my skills further.
🤔 I’m looking for help with anything that I get stuck with! 
💬 Ask me about being a science teacher 🧪 or tennis coach 🎾
