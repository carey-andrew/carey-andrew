   Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Andy
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve recently completed the School of code bootcamp, presenting our final project on Jan 10th.
On Github you can find the project that we built in 4 weeks - Bubble, as well as other apps that I have made as part of my learning.
The Bubble promo video can be found here https://youtu.be/z7_tHfFPTTU
