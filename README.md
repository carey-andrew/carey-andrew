### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve recently completed the School of code bootcamp, presenting our final project on Jan 10th.
On Github you can find the project that we built in 4 weeks - Bubble, as well as other apps that I have made as part of my learning.

Current Tech Stack: JavaScript | Node.JS | Express.JS | Playwright | Figma | HTML | CSS | PostgresSQL | React | Next.JS | Chakra UI & more to come!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on a portfolio website, applying for my first role and creating a roadmap to develop my skills further.
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with anything that I get stuck with! 
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about being a science teacher ðŸ§ª or tennis coach ðŸŽ¾
ðŸ“« How to reach me: andycareycode@gmail.com 
âš¡ Fun fact: I have run 5 marathons (all before I had kids!)
